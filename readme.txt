The "surround" plates are made of one clear and one colored piece of 3mm acrylic.

The "bottom" plates are 1.5mm G50 galvanized steel and use m3x0.5mm threaded holes

The switch plates are recommended to be aluminum for the weight, but G50 can be cheaper and other materials may be preffered/substituted

m3x20mm screws are used to hold everything together, these are inserted and threaded 1.5mm into the bottom once all the parts are stacked

the "Delta Clips" are introduced lastly, creating tension in the stack and separating the parts.
